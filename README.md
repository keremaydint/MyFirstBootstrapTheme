    The Freelancer theme consists of several sections. The navbar section includes the logo and links to pages, which lead to the respective pages when clicked.
    The homepage features an avatar and the person's name.
    The portfolio section comprises a title and six photos. Links can be added to the photo sections.
    The About section provides detailed information about the person. This section is divided into two columns, and there is a button just below it.
